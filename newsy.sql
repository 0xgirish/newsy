They are from Delhi and worked as delivery boys for various logistic companies engaged in delivery of goods for e-commerce companies. The officials said that the three men had been operating for the past 2-3 months and allegedly replaced the returned goods with fakes or dummies.\n\nThey roped in their people who would place orders as customers with Flipkart. The orders were booked from locations where these three men operated and were tasked to deliver the goods. Once the order was received, the company sent the ordered items through these delivery men to the customers. But the persons ordering the goods refused to accept them on one pretext or the other, AK Maurya, the officiating senior superintendent of police, said.\n\nOnce the orders were refused by the customer, the men would return it to the company. But before they returned, they opened the boxes and replaced the goods with fakes or dummies. This activity made the company suspicious and they filed an FIR, Maurya added.\n\nThe FIR was filed at Link Road police station, as the men delivered the fakes in Surya Nagar, Ramprastha and delta colonies among others. The police said that the trio allegedly duped the company to the tune of nearly 10 lakh.\n\nWe suspected something fishy since January. We detected the fraud when the returned goods were checked and we found duplicate hard disks returned in packets. As many as 24 such instances came to light. A majority of these orders were placed for external hard disks.

Since then, as many as 2,558 applications have been received by the Garhwal range.\n\nData accessed from the police reveals that a total of 909 people have been arrested in the last three and a half years in such cases.\n\nIn the last three months of 2014, the SIT received 39 cases and in 2015, the number of applications were 474. This increased to 1,238 in 2016, and the next year there were 747 applications. In 2018, the SIT has already received 60 applications so far.\n\nIn regards to the number of arrests, 2016 had the most number of arrests with the figure being 625. This was followed by 213 arrests in 2015, and 71 in 2017. This year, police have arrested nearly 15 people in seven cases that were registered last year.\n\nThe need for the SIT was felt because the cops at the police station level were not equipped with adequate resources. Most of the land fraud cases are from Dehradun. The reason could be the citys growth in the recent years, said Pushpak Jyoti, DIG, Garhwal range.\n\nHe however added that there have been occasions when people file false complaints due to ill will. Before investigating a case in detail, the SIT conducts a screening to ascertain veracity of the complaint. We dont entertain cases that are pending in civil courts, the DIG said.\n\nThe rise in the number of land fraud cases, especially in Dehradun, can be closely attributed to the growth of the city as a real estate hub in the last 18 years.\n\nDehradun suddenly became very important from the real estate point of view after it was declared the state capital. The land value rose exponentially, which in turn brought land sharks to the city, says Aloke B Lal, former director general of police, Uttarakhand. He adds that prior to 2000, people owned large swathes of land in Dehradun and they were not even bothered to erect boundaries and look after it.\n\nOver the last decade or so, ownership titles of many of these lands have been forged and fake wills prepared. There are also many lands which are owned by people but they have not come to Dehradun for years. So, over the years, land sharks occupied such plots. Furthermore, since the old land records are lying with the revenue authorities in Sahranpur, it became easier for people to float forged documents, he says.\n\nBut Dehradun is not alone in this.\n\nThe trend can also be seen in Rishikesh, Haridwar and Mussoorie says SS Pangtey, a former bureaucrat.\n\nMost of the big land frauds in Dehradun and Mussoorie pertain to lands that were once held by the inhabitants during the British era. To look after the properties, many of them formed trusts. But since over the time the members of the trust died and the trust too became defunct, there was no one to look after these plots. People with vested interests started claiming their ownership by forging documents and they could do so easily because there was no one alive to oppose them.\n\nHowever, not all applications filed before the SIT pertain to land frauds. Many involve disputes over demarcation, encroachments and violence. Such cases are referred to the district administration and the SSPs concerned, the DIG said.\n\nOf all 2,558 applications that the SIT received, 230 were found to false and in 429, the parties arived at mutual consensus.\n\nFactfile\n\nYear Applications Arrested False cases Settled mutually\n\n2014 39 0 5 6\n\n2015 474 213 39 55\n\n2016 1,238 625 107 190\n\n2017 747 71 78 174\n\n2018 60 0 1 4\n\nTotal 2,558 909 230 439', 'https://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_960x540/HT/p2/2018/03/19/Pictures/fraud_7f0506f0-2b83-11e8-a5fc-524b5b61153f.jpg', 'Hindustan Times', '2018-03-19 17:25:00'),

The project was delayed because of the delay in acquiring the FRA certificate of 80.03 hectares of forest land of the total 133 hectares required for project.\n\nThe Pune district collectorate has already approved the project and the Raigad collectorate is likely to issue the certificate within the next two days with all required procedures completed, said MSRDC officials on Monday.\n\nThe issuance of the FRA certificate has taken a long time as it was important to check whether the respective land belongs to any tribal community. Till date, we have received the certificate from the Pune collectorate while Raigad collectorate has completed all the necessary procedure and is expected to release the certificate in the next two days. This will tremendously speed up the process, said Shankar Dhote,chief engineer at MSRDC.\n\nMSRDC officials citied that they had issued the request for proposal (RFP) to 16 contractors; eight for the viaduct and eight for the tunnel; last week. The contractors will have to carry out a detailed study and approach MSRDC within the next 45 days.

The project is expected to be completed in three years.\n\nAccording to the states government resolution dated November 24, 2017, it was decided to construct a 13.5km bypass between Khalapur toll plaza and Kusgaon, which will reduce travel time by almost 20 minutes. For the project, MSRDC had called two separate tenders, one each for the viaduct and for the tunnel.

Doctors carried out 20,454 sterilisation operations in 2014-15. It decreased to 19,847 the next year, and by 2016-17 it was down to 17,797.\n\nThis was revealed in a written reply by the Union ministry of health and family welfare in the Lok Sabha on March 16.\n\nAt the national level, the decrease in sterilisation operations was only 2.38%. Neighbouring Himachal Pradesh also recorded a decrease of 11%.\n\nSpeaking on this, Dr Archana Srivastava, director general, health, said, Male sterilisation has always remained a problem across states. This is reflective of our patriarchal mindset that the responsibility of family planning rests with the women.\n\nShe added that the health department is working towards promoting family welfare programmes. Our total fertility rate (TFR) is 2.1, which is better than the national figure. We have already achieved a replacement status in terms of TFR. Other areas are also being worked upon.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organisation, TFR is the total number of children that are born or likely to be born to a woman in her life time. A TFR of 2.1 is called replacement-level fertility.\n\nIt represents the average number of children a woman would need to have to reproduce by bearing a daughter who survives to childbearing age. If replacement level fertility is sustained over a sufficiently long period, each generation will exactly replace itself without any need for the country to balance the population by international migration, the WHO says.\n\nEarlier, the National Family Health Survey (NFHS)-4 had also stated that the use of family planning methods among married women in Uttarakhand has decreased by nearly 10% between 2004-05 and 2015-16.\n\nAccording to the report, only 53.4% married women, aged between 15-49 years, in the state use any type of family planning methods (sterilisation, pills, condoms, etc), as opposed to 59.3% in 2004-05.\n\nThe prevalence of male sterilisation in the state has decreased from 1.8% in 2005-06 to just 0.7% in 2015-16. Similarly, female sterilization has also witnessed a decrease from 32.2% prevalence in NFHS-3 to 27.4% in the latest survey.\n\nThe report also states that female sterilisation is more popular among women in rural areas of Uttarakhand. Nearly 32% women in rural areas adopted sterilisation as a family planning method, against 18.7 % women in urban areas.\n\nDr Prasoon Sheoran, assistant director, reproductive and child health, Uttarakhand, said, Lack of awareness among people and migration are major impediments in promoting sterilisation. There are societal taboos associated with it and communities in districts like Haridwar and Udham Singh Nagar are prejudiced against sterilisation. We are working on awareness campaigns to check this.\n\nHe added that over the years, the use of other forms of temporary contraceptives like condoms, Copper T and contraceptive pills have also increased.\n\nMeanwhile, NFHS-4 also states that the use of condoms as a contraceptive increased marginally and it was found to be prevalent among only 16% people. In 2004-05, the figure was 15.7%.

The award was to be conferred on March 18. However, after some local groups objected to the derogatory references to Meera Bai, the academy cancelled the award at the last minute.\n\nThe academys functioning has come in for criticism by several authors after this.\n\nEminent author Nand Bhardwaj said authors should exercise caution while writing about historical characters.

The way the academy handled this is wrong. It is an insult to the author. But when you have political appointees in these organisations what else can you expect? he said.\n\nAuthor Hetu Bhardwaj, former chairperson of the academy, said the chairman acted hastily. He should have stood by the decision of the academy. It was his moral duty. Instead of postponing the award, he should have said that the academy would get it examined.\n\nLast year, a vociferous protest by Rajputs over the film Padmavat led to it being banned in Rajasthan for distorting facts and hurting sentiments.\n\nReacting to the controversy, Harsh said he was saddened that people were perturbed by small issues. As a society, we do not have the courage to face the truth and we link our honour to our past.\n\nHarsh said he was informed by the academy chairperson Dr Indushekhar Tatpurush at the last minute that a local media had reported that Harshs book made derogatory references to Meera and the Mewar Maharanas and this could lead to a controversy so they were cancelling the award.\n\nI told him awards do not matter to me and I would cooperate with him.

Meera accepted and told him to come to her house the next evening. He felt very ashamed and later became her disciple, said Harsh. In fact, the way Meera handled him, shows her strength of character.\n\nAfter the cancellation, the academy chairperson in a short statement said it had postponed the 2017-18 Rangeya Raghav award after a meeting of the Saraswati Sabha.

Indias current account deficit (CAD) widened to 2% of gross domestic product, or $13.5 billion, in the December quarter, up from 1.4%, or $8 billion, a year ago.\n\nAccording to Amar Ambani, partner and head of research, IIFL Investment Managers, a higher CAD hurt investor sentiment, but other local problems relating to the Punjab National Bank fraud and the regulator barring banks from issuing letters of undertaking have also had an impact.\n\nInvestors are increasingly worried about the 2019 general election after the UP by-polls results rattled sentiments, he added.\n\nLast week, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party lost two key parliamentary seats it held in Uttar Pradesh.\n\nAmbani said the Nifty may further correct by 3-4% and warned it could soon touch 9,700 points.\n\nIn a note on Monday, Kotak Institutional Equities said the surprising defeat of the BJP in the Uttar Pradesh by-polls and the Telugu Desam Partys announcement to pull out of the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance will likely increase speculation about the nature of pre-poll alliances for the 2019 general election and the nature of the centres policies over the next 12 months.\n\nInvestors will also be watching the outcome of the US Federal Reserves monetary policy meeting on Wednesday. After hawkish comments by new chief Jerome Powell, the US central bank is expected to increase rates faster than earlier anticipated. US rate increases generally lead to outflow of foreign funds from emerging markets considered to be riskier assets.\n\nSome analysts such as Vinod Karki, vice-president (strategy) at ICICI Securities Ltd, do not see any impact on foreign funds despite rate hikes by the Fed. Right now, Indian markets are weighed by global concerns about the trade war threat while introduction of long-term capital gains tax, high valuations and election uncertainties are causing jitters among investors, he said.', 'https://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_960x540/HT/p2/2018/03/19/Pictures/sensex_daf907de-2b94-11e8-a965-f54d0b6b9edf.jpg', 'Hindustan Times', '2018-03-19 16:47:00'),

Zaidi said that the villagers seem to have breached the protection wall of Sorsan forest to gain entry for them and their cattle in the forest area.\n\nVillagers take their cattle to the water bodies of Sorsan, which keeps wildlife creatures, particularly blackbucks and chinkaras, away from the water bodies, he said.\n\nHe demanded that the wildlife department should repair the breached wall and check the entry of village cattle. If the entry of village cattle in the water bodies will be left unchecked, it will lead to water crisis for chinkara and blackbucks in Sorsan, he added.\n\nCommenting over the issue, Rajeev Kapoor, the deputy conservator of forest in Baran, said that efforts would be made to contain cattle from entering the water bodies of Sorsan.

Once it is done, the police department will start manning these posts, he said.\n\nIn January, the Uttarakhand high court had ordered the state government to replace the revenue police with regular police within six months. The court had said that the old revenue policing system, a legacy of the British-era, has become obsolete to deal with crime in the present day scenario.\n\nUnder the revenue police system, patwaris are empowered to arrest and investigate cases falling under their revenue jurisdiction. This makes Uttarakhand the only state in the country to have this system.\n\nThe system was introduced by the British to oversee day-to-day law and order situation in the remote areas. Since the crime rate was low, need for regular police was not felt, and revenue officials were given the additional task.\n\nEven today, nearly 60% of the geographical area in the state is under the revenue police.\n\nWhen asked how the department plans to meet the manpower and infrastructure required to replace revenue police from 61% area within six months, the DGP said, Most of the population is already under the regular police. Revenue policing is present in the hills and the population density there is less. One police station in the hills has a large area in its jurisdiction but the population in it is small as compared to the plains.\n\nHe added that the department will require huge funds to implement the courts order in one go within six months.\n\nMeanwhile, experts say that even though replacing revenue police with regular police has become indispensible today, it will be very difficult for the government to do it in six months.\n\nThere are serious challenges in the interior areas due to the absence of regular police. The understanding of a patwari in a bordering district about intelligence gathering can be very limited. Intelligence collection is an important factor of policing in these regions, especially if we have a porous border like the one with Nepal, said Aloke B Lal, former DGP, Uttarakhand.\n\nAbout completing the task within six months, he said, To implement the courts order in six months will be very difficult. Besides recruitment, there are challenges of arranging equipment, getting clearances, constructing buildings etc. The new recruits cannot be sent directly to these areas. They have to be trained. The department cant rope in existing trained staff because then other areas will suffer. Besides, at a time when the government does not have funds even for paying salaries, creating so many police stations will be a big challenge.\n\nFormer administrative member of board of revenue, SS Pangety echoes the same. The situation in the hills is so grave that revenue policing is obsolete. Banks have been operationalised in the hills but there is no security arrangement in absence of regular police. The crime rate is also increasing, he said.\n\nHe added that getting permissions for creating new posts, recruitment, land procurement, equipment etc will take time because there are many stages and many departments involved in this. Doing it in six months will be very difficult, he said.', 'https://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_960x540/HT/p2/2018/03/19/Pictures/present-government-geographical-extend-regular-uttarakhand-police_09950b5c-2b94-11e8-8732-87a46da2a8cc.JPG', 'Hindustan Times', '2018-03-19 16:41:00'),

Doval has had a close working relationship with outgoing CIA director Pompeo and his successor and has hotline to his counterpart McMaster.\n\nAccording to US and Indian diplomats familiar with the details, Doval will carry forward the spadework done by foreign secretary Vijay Gokhale and defence secretary Sanjay Mitra, who returned after holding preparatory meetings for the two-plus-two dialogue on Sunday night. It is understood that both sides have decided to deepen their defence cooperation and synchronised their views on the Indo-Pacific as well as the Quad relationship, an in-the-works grouping of India, the US, Japan, and Australia to counter Chinas growing clout in the region.\n\nThe diplomats said the preparatory work included discussions on the long pending bilateral Communications, Compatibility and Security Agreement (COMCASA) and the Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement (BECA). India and the US have been discussing all aspects of the two agreements and Washington has addressed all of New Delhis concerns to the latters satisfaction, they added. The COMCASA is a precursor to Indian acquiring US advanced defence technologies and BECA is the foundation to any spatial cooperation between the two. While Indias opposition parties have tried to make a national security issue out of these two foundation agreements, COMCASA and BECA are at the heart of any future substantial defence cooperation between the two strategic partners, the diplomats said. The two agreements will be taken up for final discussions during the two-plus-two ministerial dialogue.\n\nHindustan Times also learned that the two Indian secretaries were able to synchronise the views of New Delhi and Washington on what constitutes Indo-Pacific and the role of key Asean countries in any initiative to ensure freedom of navigation in the region. The two countries have also decided in favour of more complex military to military exercises, including advanced bilateral naval exercises in the Indo-Pacific. The diplomats said Indias defence secretary Sanjay Mitra reviewed the offer of unarmed Guardian drones as well as air combat platforms from Washington. According to them, Doval will take this a step further by exploring the possibility of India acquiring armed drones and of top US contractors like Boeing and Lockheed Martin opening fighter production and maintenance lines in India.\n\nDuring his visit, Doval will also review developments in the Afghanistan-Pakistan region, given the Ashraf Ghani governments predilection to bringing a section of Taliban to the table for dialogue with help of Pakistan. While India has consistently opposed dialogue with Taliban insurgents for long-term stability of Kabul, there is an element within the Trump administration which wants to use the Pakistan line to negotiate with Taliban. With Pakistan heading for elections, Doval is also expected to discuss the role of the Muslim Milli League, a party floated by Lashkar-e-Taiba emir and 26/11 mastermind Hafiz Saeed, in Pakistan polity, according to the diplomats.', 'https://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_960x540/HT/p2/2018/03/19/Pictures/nsa-ajit-doval-at-parliament-house_cd665a06-2b92-11e8-a965-f54d0b6b9edf.jpg', 'Hindustan Times', '2018-03-19 16:36:00'),

The tigress was last cited on February 21 with a four-year-old male tiger (ST-11) in Umri area of the reserve and there it was observed that the radio collar was not functioning.\n\nSources said the radio collar has been defunct since February 7.\n\nThe Sariska Tiger Reserve (STR) administration has ordered over 70 additional camera traps for clues to track the tigress.

These included a sweet shop in the north Mumbai suburb of Kandivli, police said.This is not the first time that the MNS has attacked properties owned by Gujaratis in Maharashtra. In July 2017, the party had launched violent protests against a jewellery shop and a hotel in Mumbai, forcing them to pull down their signboards written in Gujarati.After the Vasai incident, MNS Thane region president Avinash Jadhav said, "Vasai is in Maharashtra and not in Gujarat. We will not tolerate signboards in Gujarati."Addressing the party workers at a rally at Shivaji Park in central Mumbai last night, Mr Thackeray had said, "The country is fed up with the false promises made by (Prime Minister) Narendra Modi and his government.""All the opposition parties should come together to get rid of the BJP-led NDA government to ensure a Modi-mukt Bharat," he had said, while reminding the audience of the BJP\'s "Congress-mukt Bharat" slogan.Describing the vandalism by MNS workers as a nuisance tactic, a political analyst said, "Raj Thackeray is doing what he is best known for. He should understand that the times have changed and the people are interested in constructive policies."The MNS chief has been critical of PM Modi as according to him, the latter wants to shift all the major establishments from Maharashtra to Gujarat. In 2008, the MNS had started a campaign to ensure that signboards across Mumbai were in Marathi.In 2016, during Paryushan, the fasting period of the Jain community, the MNS had opposed the closure of meat shops and opened them forcibly.', 'https://i.ndtvimg.com/i/2018-03/mns_650x400_51521477843.jpg', 'Hindustan Times', NULL),

I\'m for complete communal and social peace... I want to make it clear that this country will march ahead on the basis of love, compassion and communal harmony".He then went on to support Union Minister and LJP chief Ram Vilas Paswan, who yesterday advised ally BJP on the "need to change mass perception among Dalits and minorities". "I know Paswan very well and without applying his mind he won\'t speak on these issues," Mr Kumar said.BJP leaders in the state declined to comment over the remarks.The Chief Minister\'s remarks came in the backdrop of day-long opposition protests in the state assembly against Union Minister Giriraj Singh and Ashwini Choubey.Last week, after victory of Lalu Yadav\'s Rashtriya Janata Dal won the by-elections for Araria parliamentary seat in face of an aggressive BJP campaign, Mr Singh had said the district will become a "hub of terror". It had created a huge controversy, with the opposition RJD calling the remark communal.On Sunday, Mr Singh was caught on camera inciting a mob to shout slogans against a senior police officer in Darbhanga, where a man was hacked to death.

A police case was filed against Abhijit Sashwat. Before this, Mr Kumar also broke his silence on special status, saying Bihar has not shed this demand.

For cheap vote bank politics, you are playing a dirty game.

This reflects the discriminatory policies of the BJP government," she said.The BSP president said that instead of lashing at the opposition for the defeat on Phulpur and Gorakhpur seats, Adityanath should have resigned on moral grounds as people had given a clear message that the state government should use the time and resources on people\'s welfare shunning the RSS\'s agenda of hatred.She also contested the claims of the Yogi government that no riot took place in the state referring to the Kasganj violence.To a question on NDA allies expressing views against the BJP government, she said that MLAs and ministers of the BJP will also open their mouth against them as there is difference between what they say and what they do.

Police in New Delhi said they have received the complaint but declined to discuss the matter further.The two firms are the Children\'s Investment Fund Foundation, a charity of the British billionaire Christopher Hohn, knighted for his philanthropic work in 2014, and Axon Partners, an equity firm run by former Goldman Sachs executive Dinakar Singh.Both firms declined to comment.Goyal declined to comment on the allegations through an IREO spokeswoman. But in a March 13 letter to IREO investors he wrote that "as far as the allegation of fraud, diversion and misappropriation of funds is concerned, this is false, baseless and devoid of any merit."Donald Trump Jr. called IREO "truly a fantastic group" when the companies announced the project in April 2016. Dusty, water-starved Gurgaon has seen rampant and largely unregulated growth in recent years of gated high-rise communities and soaring office towers that house multinational corporations.The Trump Organization did not return emails or telephone calls requesting comment on the criminal complaint, which does not refer to the organization\'s partnership with IREO.Trump Jr. visited India in February on a tour packed with glitzy events to promote his family company\'s other Trump-branded towers in the cities of Pune, Mumbai and Kolkata, as well as new residential towers just a few miles away from the planned IREO office tower. The visit was criticized by ethics watchdog groups after buyers of luxury apartment homes were offered "a conversation and dinner" with Trump Jr. in exchange for a $38,000 booking fee.Trump Jr., the organization\'s executive vice president, did not actively promote the IREO project on that trip, although he told CNBC\'s Indian affiliate that the company has "five incredible deals that are all active," which would include IREO.Goyal and Bhargava, a U.S. resident on the board of the University of Pennsylvania\'s engineering school, in 2004 founded the IREO group of funds, designed to inject foreign capital in what was then a relatively untested real estate market. It now manages over $1.6 billion from sovereign wealth and university endowment funds, a portfolio of 1,485 acres in the Delhi area and in the state of Punjab, and 18 million square feet of commercial and residential projects in development.Bhargava did not respond to telephone calls or emails requesting comment on the criminal complaint.Goyal said in an interview with The Post in the spring of 2017 that the company first approached the Trump Organization about partnering on a commercial real estate tower around 2013. An early deal fell through, but the two parties signed a licensing agreement in 2016 for the luxury office building that included use of the Trump name, "technical assistance" and a percentage of the lease income, Goyal said."We thought Trump would be the ideal partner," Goyal said. In a 2016 meeting on the project, Trump Jr. was "very focused on what the commercial building should be. The shape of the glass, what customers like. He was very businesslike," Goyal said.According to a 2017 letter to investors, Singh and Hohn were growing increasingly frustrated that IREO\'s managers seemed difficult to reach and had shown no indication that they were going to return investor money as scheduled, along with what they promised would be significant profits.They launched legal proceedings in the island nation of Mauritius - where the funds are based - and talks to restructure the funds to increase investor control and manager accountability."[A]fter roughly 10 years, we estimate that investors have received distributions of only $250 million, while management has collected over $300 million in management fees, and to this day management does not have a plan for returning out capital before the end of various funds\' lives," they wrote to investors in April 2017.In a Feb. 24 Barron\'s article, Goyal said that IREO had managed to weather the 2008 global financial crisis when others failed to survive."Our strategy, good and bad, preserved the investor money, and we are very hopeful they will get much more than what they invested back," he told the magazine.Now, however, the Children\'s Investment Fund Foundation and Axon are alleging in the criminal complaint filed last month with the New Delhi police department\'s economic offenses wing that Goyal and others established a fraudulent web of companies and entities and phony charges to divert more than $147 million into their own pockets. In one case, they allege, a project in an undeveloped area in the state of Rajasthan - where no licenses or land certificates were ever obtained - was "nothing but a sham . . . to misappropriate about $62 million."A former CEO of the company, Ramesh Sanka, alerted the investors to potential fraud. His statements and records form the basis of the investors\' criminal complaint and as well as Sanka\'s own whistleblower complaints filed with police and the civil court in neighboring Gurgaon, also known as Gurugram.In an interview, Sanka said he joined IREO in 2014 and grew concerned when he learned that a group of IREO home buyers went to the police and complained that their apartments had been canceled but their money had not been refunded. He began his own investigation, gathering documents from the area planning office and other government agencies.He left the company in 2016, he said, "once I was convinced these frauds were true and deep-rooted."In his March 13 letter to investors on behalf of IREO, Goyal says that the legal proceedings will discourage investors and buyers and are a "needless and unwarranted distraction" that will cause "significant damage and harm to IREO" at a sensitive time when it is in the midst of refinancing. The company has had a cash crunch due to India\'s moribund real estate market and the government\'s move to pull its higher value currency out of circulation to combat tax cheats, it has said. Some of IREO\'s land is also caught up in an ongoing court dispute and a probe by India\'s Central Bureau of Investigation, court records show.Goyal also addressed Sanka\'s charges in the letter to investors, saying: "We find the timing of his alleged \'whistle blowing\' curious and the manner suspicious to say the least.

"Longer term studies are currently underway to confirm that DMAU taken every day blocks sperm production," she added.', 'https://i.ndtvimg.com/i/2018-03/medicine_650x400_51521474509.jpg', 'Hindustan Times', NULL),

He said the amendment would result in a complete ban on running of hookah bars in the state.The proposed amendment would be presented before the Vidhan Sabha, and if passed by the House, would be reserved for the assent of the President of India, he added.Under the present scheme of things, section 144 of CrPC is promulgated against the hookah bars across the country for two months, which requires an extension at the end of the period.The extension orders are issued every two months by the district administration.

Therefore, we have started agitation and have decided not to participate in matric answer paper evaluation process," said Mr Mohanty.School and Mass Education Minister Badri Narayan Patra requested the teachers to withdraw their agitation and claimed that the government is ready with a contingency plan if the teaches stick to their stand."We appeal to the teachers to cooperate in the matric answer paper evaluation process in the larger interest of the students.

Effective action will be taken if a video or any other evidence is uploaded on the portal. This will deliver a lethal blow against the corrupt elements," Yogi Adityanath claimed."Our government will come up with four lakh jobs in as many as 64 departments ranging from police constables to sub-inspectors, block development officers and revenue officials," he said. Yogi Adityanath said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has frequently referred to the alleged anomalies in recruitments by the UP Public Service Commission in the past."Even the Supreme Court had to act and halt the police recruitment as it was biased and there was rampant corruption. The election promise of ending the interview process for group-C and group-D during recruitment, which was encouraging corruption, has been implemented by us," he said."Today I can say that UP, where there was no law and order and anarchy was prevalent, is witnessing a change," the chief minister said."A faith has been reposed...Some people are afraid of monkeys, but I can say that a monkey had destroyed Ravana\'s Lanka, and the monkeys will play their role in the war against corruption and goonda raj," he said.He was apparently hitting back at SP MLC Anand Bhadauria who had recently posted a \'monkey joke\' on social media to take a jibe at the government.Attacking the previous state governments, he said, "Contracts were given for mass copying in various examinations. When we initiated fair examination, nearly 12 lakh students opted out...Later, it was revealed that 75 per cent of them were Munnabhais (contractual cheats) from other states."Yogi Adityanath said that during verification of ration cards, it was found that there were 30 lakh fake ration cards.The chief minister asserted there was an improvement in law and order with provision of on-line FIR and foot patrolling."When our government took over the reins of the state, the coffers were virtually empty. There were pot-holed roads, a VIP culture was prevalent, farmers were committing suicide, traders were also leaving the state and youths appeared to be misguided. We stopped redundant expenses, and came up with a crop loan redemption scheme, becoming the first state to do so. Over 86 lakh farmers have benefitted from this scheme," he said.The chief minister also remarked that in UP\'s politics, casteism, divisive forces and dynastic politics were ruling the roost.However, under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the state has been freed of divisive politics, he said."For the first time, the agenda of the government is to think about the welfare of the poor, villagers, Dalits, people from deprived sections and those belonging to the last strata of the society," he said.Yogi Adityanath said the \'One District - One Product\' scheme of his government will help in generation of 20 lakh jobs in the next three years.In his speech, Governor Ram Naik said "The governor acts as a bridge between the Centre and state. Earlier I had made efforts (to act as a bridge) but now there is no need." Mr Naik also said that the recently-held UP Investors\' Summit was a bold step and exuded confidence that UP will become \'Uttam Pradesh\'.A grand cultural programme was held on this occasion and a multi-colour booklet titled \'Ek Saal - Nayee Misaal\' with the punchline \'Huaa Vikaas - Badha Vishwaas\' was unveiled.', 'https://i.ndtvimg.com/i/2018-03/yogi-adityanath-650_650x400_61521442877.jpg', 'Hindustan Times', NULL),

Suddenly, taking up a sentimental issue and trying to bring a no-confidence motion is something that they have to explain to the people of Andhra Pradesh," said Ram Madhav, BJP general secretary.Of those who will support the no-confidence motion, the Congress has 48 MPs in the Lok Sabha, the Trinamool Congress has 34, the TDP has 16, the YSR Congress and the CPM have nine MPs each, the NPC has six, AAP and the RJD have four MPs each, and the AIMIM has one MP. In the \'Others\' category, those supporting the motion number 13 MPs."As far as the Left parties are concerned, we will be supporting the no confidence motion. People have started expressing their no confidence in the Modi government , it\'s time Parliament does it too," said Duraisamy Raja of the CPI.YSR Congress was the first to give a notice last week for a no-trust motion after the Centre made it clear that it would not grant special category status to Andhra Pradesh. Not to be outdone by its main rival in the state, TDP, a long-time BJP ally, then decided to break its ties over the issue and brought a no-confidence motion of its own.Both parties have been lobbying with opposition parties for support to their respective notices. A no-confidence motion notice must be supported by at least 50 MPs to be taken up in the House. The government earlier expressed confidence that the notices, even if they are admitted, will be defeated given its strength in Lok Sabha, where the ruling NDA has a clear majority.', 'https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-63362599,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-152217,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg', 'Hindustan Times', NULL),

The Nobel prize winning economist, Paul Krugman confirms what weve been saying for over two years now. Mass unemployment is the biggest threat India faces. Unfortunately, we have a PM who lives in denial. Afraid his \'Acche Din\' PR will take a beating", tweeted the Congress president.Krugman, the American economist who won a Nobel Prize in 2008, warned that India could end up with huge mass unemployment if it does not grow its manufacturing sector, reported The Economic Times."There is this concept called artificial intelligence that you should be wary of. In future, while diagnosis may be outsourced to a doctor in India, it could also go to a firm based on artificial intelligence. Things like this could be a cause for worry for Indian services sector," Krugman said while speaking at a media event over the weekend.Krugman said that in Asia, India could take the lead but only if it also develops its manufacturing sector.Indias lack in the manufacturing sector could work against it, as it doesn\'t have the jobs essential to sustain the projected growth in demography. You have to find jobs for people, he said.Yesterday, the Congress president referred to the World Bank\'s biannual India Development Update report which pegs the GST system among the most complex in the world, with not only one of the highest tax rates but also one of the largest number of tax slabs."Modi ji, the terror of Gabbar Singh Tax is now globally acclaimed. The World Bank says its the 2nd HIGHEST in the WORLD and one of the MOST complex," Rahul said in a tweet on Sunday."The tax rates in the Indian GST system are among the highest in the world.

Effective action will be taken if a video or any other evidence is uploaded on the portal.

The election promise of ending the interview process for group-C and group-D during recruitment, which was encouraging corruption, has been implemented by us," he said.Today I can say that UP, where there was no law and order and anarchy was prevalent, is witnessing a change, the chief minister said."A faith has been reposed...Some people are afraid of monkeys, but I can say that a monkey had destroyed Ravana\'s Lanka, and the monkeys will play their role in the war against corruption and goonda raj," he said.He was apparently hitting back at SP MLC Anand Bhadauria who had recently posted a \'monkey joke\' on social media to take a jibe at the government.Attacking the previous state governments, he said, "Contracts were given for mass copying in various examinations.

There were pot-holed roads, a VIP culture was prevalent, farmers were committing suicide, traders were also leaving the state and youths appeared to be misguided. We stopped redundant expenses, and came up with a crop loan redemption scheme, becoming the first state to do so.

Earlier I had made efforts (to act as a bridge) but now there is no need."Naik also said that the recently-held UP Investors\' Summit was a bold step and exuded confidence that UP will become \' Uttam Pradesh \'.A grand cultural programme was held on this occasion and a multi-colour booklet titled \'Ek Saal - Nayee Misaal\' with the punchline \'Huaa Vikaas - Badha Vishwaas \' was unveiled.', 'https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-63367175,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-165802,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg', 'Hindustan Times', NULL),

The boy, who was inspired by the American movie Airport to make the call, was granted bail on Monday as he has no criminal background.\n\nOn October 19 last year, the class 8 student had called the IGI airport stating that there was a bomb in one of the Delhi-Mumbai flights. Many flights were delayed because of the call as the bomb threat assessment committee convened to check the threat.\n\nAccording to the police, the call was received at the Udyog Vihar Phase-3 call centre. One of the executives from the call centre had filed a police complaint after which a case was registered at the Udyog Vihar police station.\n\nI searched for the (IGI) airports number on Google and took my mothers mobile number to make the call (about a bomb in a Delhi-Mumbai flight). Later, I forgot to even check if that flight was delayed or cancelled. I was influenced by the movie Airport and I wanted to do something adventurous, so I made the call, the teenager told members of the District Child Protection Unit (DCPU) before being produced before the Juvenile Justice Board (JJB).\n\nAppearing before JJB principal magistrate Davender Singh, the boy said he had seen children play pranks in movies and so he also decided to pull one too. However, he was unaware of the consequences of his action, he said.\n\nI am very scared to go to jail; I have only seen it (pranks) in the movies. I will not repeat my mistake, please forgive me this time. I am very sorry, sir, the juvenile told the principal magistrate while pleading guilty.\n\nPolice said that the boy studied in a private school in Bhubaneswar and is an intelligent student.\n\nThe boy was granted bail as keeping him behind the bars would serve no useful purpose, the order read. The officer also failed to show that the juvenile had a criminal background.\n\nHe is immature and has no previous criminal background. If the juvenile is sent to the observation home in Faridabad he will come in contact with other juveniles, which is not in the interest of the juvenile.

AAP MLA Sukhpal Singh Khaira, the leader of opposition in the Punjab assembly, who had effectively led the charge on the government during the winter session, announced plans to bring out an extensive chargesheet against the state government, listing its failures, and then go after it with all guns blazing during the budget session.\n\nBut before the AAP and its firebrand leader could thrum into top gear, the news of Kejriwals apology to Majithia in a defamation case came out. All hell broke loose and furious MLAs, worried about the political implications of their chiefs act, revolted against the leadership, threatening to split the party.\n\nThough the break-up threat fizzled out after 10 of the 20 MLAs met Kejriwal on Sunday and endorsed his rationale behind the apology, the partys script to take on the Amarinder government seems to have gone haywire. As planned, Khaira and others released the chargesheet on Friday, accusing the state government of corruption, betraying the farmers on debt waiver, failure to curb mining mafia, going soft on the Badal family and its over-dependence on babus.\n\nIt got lost in brouhaha over the apology, with hardly anyone taking note of the principal opposition partys charges against the Congress government on completion of one year. Khaira held a meeting of the AAP legislature party to discuss their strategy in the budget session commencing Tuesday. Though he full-throatedly voices his views after such meetings, the firebrand leader was not in his element this time, making do with a brief press note after the meeting.\n\nWhile both sides maintained uneasy silence on the apology episode throughout the day, last weeks dramatic developments appear to have deepened the distrust among some prominent leaders that will be hard to bridge. There have already been worries in the party on account of lack of cohesion among its leaders and the present situation does not augur well.\n\nHowever, Punjab AAP co-president Aman Arora said any difference of opinion on the apology issue was a matter within the party. It will have no bearing on the MLAs performance in the state assembly. We will raise issues of people and take on the government, he said.

The system of Letter of Undertaking or LOUs, which allows the customer of a bank to withdraw foreign currency from an Indian bank in another nation, was scrapped by the Reserve Bank of India after Mr Modi and his partner Mehul Choksi perpetrated the massive fraud.The ED said "grave miscarriage of justice" will be caused to its probe if Firestar Diamond\'s plea for stay of further proceedings is granted.

It was applied retrospectively from January 1, 2006.\n\nThe current entry-level salary for a junior civil judge is around Rs 45,000 per month, while a senior judge gets around Rs 80,000.\n\nGiven that there are 28% vacancies in the lower judiciary on an average, it remains to be seen if the pay hike will encourage more lawyers to join the subordinate judiciary, said Sumathi Chandrashekharan of the VIDHI Centre for Legal Policy, adding that the increment was long overdue.\n\nThe commission said it will release a consultation paper in the next few days to seek answers from the registrar generals of 24 high courts as well as all state government to examine the methods, work environments in courts and various allowances and benefits made available to judicial officers, in addition to their salaries.', 'https://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_960x540/HT/p2/2018/03/19/Pictures/supreme-court_09b58e34-2ba0-11e8-a965-f54d0b6b9edf.jpg', 'Hindustan Times', '2018-03-19 18:06:00'),

Central India is staring at deepening water scarcity that means withdrawal of 40% of the renewable surface water resources.\n\nThe already stressed ground water resources will face even greater pressure in north India. SK Sarkar, who heads the water resources division at policy think-tank TERI, said that groundwater depletion was extremely severe in Punjab, Haryana and Delhi. Ground water depletion carries with it the risk of salinity, he said.\n\nSouth and central India will experience high levels of risk from poor water quality in its river basins by 2050. The report relies on a study done by the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis for its estimations in future scenarios.\n\nContamination is not only a problem with surface water resources but also groundwater, according to SWA Naqvi, a scientist at the Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) and NIO director, There is metallic contamination but also contamination from improper disposal of human excreta, he said.\n\nThere is growing evidence to show that because of dumping of faecal matter in the ground -- either because of open defecation or soak-pits toilets with improper disposal of faecal matter -- leads to contamination of groundwater aquifers with E-coli bacteria, according to experts.\n\nThe UNESCO report said that over 2 billion people worldwide do not have access to safe drinking water but almost twice that number of people do not have access to safe sanitation. The demand for water is expected to increase by almost one-third by 2050 compared to 2010 levels.\n\nChina, India, United States, Russia and Pakistan are the largest consumers of water at present and they will continue to be top water guzzlers in 2050.\n\nThe report attributed the water scarcity to population growth and climate change, which were not just fuelling water scarcity but also flooding in areas that are not historically flood-prone. According to the report ,the number of people exposed to flood risk surged from 1.2 billion to day to 1.6 billion in 2050, and assets valued at US $45 trillion will also be at risk.\n\nThe report recommends nature-based solution that mimic nature, citing the example of small-scale water harvesting structure in Rajasthan that quenched the water demand of 1,000 villages.\n\nAnother example of this is the underground taming of floods for irrigation (UTFI) project, that is being piloted in Ganga river basin. UTFI is a way of managing both flooding and drought because the method entails channelizing excess flow during the wet season for the recharge of aquifers, thus curbing flooding downstream. A greater recharge of groundwater helps to meet needs during a dry spell.', 'https://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_960x540/HT/p2/2018/03/19/Pictures/rajsamand-rajasthan-groundwater-rajsamand-harvesting-rajasthan-pipalantri_c8b9504c-2b9e-11e8-a965-f54d0b6b9edf.jpg', 'Hindustan Times', '2018-03-19 17:56:00'),

Today, I feel deceived," Ms Damania told NDTV.Following Ms Damania\'s allegations, Arvind Kejriwal had named Mr Gadkari as "one of the most corrupt politicians in the country". The minister hit back by moving court against Kejriwal for allegedly defaming him.After saying sorry to Punjab politician Bikram Majithia, Arvind Kejriwal today apologised to Mr Gadkari and Congress leader Kapil Sibal\'s son Amit Sibal, shedding two more defamation cases.Ms Damania, who had quit the Aam Aadmi Party in 2015, is still fighting 24 defamation cases but \'vows to fight them out till her last breath\'."In 2012 as well as in 2014, I had given Arvind clinching evidence against Mr Gadkari.

She also asked whether the courts would not have granted relief if the chief minister had pleaded for exemption from personal appearance."Arvind claims that it was to focus his strength in Delhi. Ideally, with a strong force of 67/70 MLAs (lawmakers) he should have entrusted the functioning of Delhi Government to his trusted MLAs and fought each of the cases, ensured victory in every single matter and punished these corrupt politicians," Ms Damania said.

The scholarship was withheld for the past two academic years.\n\nThe circular was issued on Friday after the state assistant commissioner, social welfare for Mumbai suburban district, ordered the institute to submit the scholarship applications of OBC, DT/NT and SBC students for the current year. The last date to apply for the scholarship is March 23.\n\nAccording to TISS authorities, they were unable to direct students from these categories towards availing these scholarships owing to a confusion over the eligibility of the institute.\n\nIn 2014, the state government announced it will no longer provide GOI-PMS scholarship to OBC, DT/NT and SBC students in deemed universities. In subsequent letters to the institute in 2016 and 2017, the government reiterated that the scholarship wont be applicable to private deemed universities and self-financed institutes. But this year it asked us to send scholarship applications, said Shajahan PK, dean, students affairs, TISS.\n\nWhile TISS is a private deemed university, its largely funded by the Centre. While the SC and ST students from the state at TISS receive GOI-PMS, the institute refused to extend the scholarship to OBC students from the academic year 2015-16 and asked them to pay their entire tuition fee upfront.\n\nThough GOI-PMS is funded by the union government, state governments are responsible for disbursing it. The conditions for availing these scholarships depend on a student\'s state of origin.\n\nThe students blame the TISS administration for its failure in bringing clarity to the issue. They also alleged that the institute intentionally \'hid\' various directives from the state government. "TISS didn\'t inform us about the availability of scholarship, even though a 2015 letter [by the director, DT/NT, OBC and SBC welfare, Maharashtra government] noted that OBC students in TISS are eligible for the scholarships," said Yashwant Zagade, an OBC PhD scholar at the institute.\n\n\'Confusion\' over GOI-PMS for OBC students\n\nIn 2014, the assistant commissioner issued a circular declaring that backward category students in deemed universities are not eligible for Government of India - Post Matric Scholarships (GOI-PMS).\n\nHowever, in a 2015 letter to the principal secretary, social justice and special assistance department, the director, DT/NT, OBC and SBC welfare, Maharashtra government, noted that the DT/NT, OBC and SBC students in enrolled in 28 courses in TISS are eligible for the scholarships.\n\nIn 2017, the assistant commissioner sent a letter to the Institute, informing about the availability of GOI_PMS for these category students. Though, it said that these scholarships are not given to the students in private deemed or self-financed universities.\n\nIn 2018, the assistant commissioner directed TISS to submit scholarship applications of DT/NT, OBC and SBC students.', 'https://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_960x540/HT/p2/2018/03/06/Pictures/tata-institute-of-social-science_a91b2254-215f-11e8-925c-925443ac9dfa.jpg', 'Hindustan Times', '2018-03-19 18:32:00'),

The court had also directed the state and central government to grant fresh environmental clearances to those whose licences had been renewed for the second time.Despite an appeal by the ruling BJP not to take to the streets, hundreds of people dependent on mining marched to the state capital, protesting against the closure of mines and demanding that mining operations resume.Earlier this month, an all-party delegation from Goa had met union ministers Nitin Gadkari and Piyush Goyal over concerns the iron ore mining industry had following the ban. The Goa Mineral Ore Exporters\' Association (GMOEA) had also approached the Prime Minister\'s Office to resolve the issue."Mining ban is a social and economic disaster as the industry and its stakeholders were just getting back to work after the lifting of the ban last time," GMOEA president Ambar Timblo told NDTV."The agitation appears to be due to no clarity going forward as most stakeholders felt that the worst was already behind them, only to be stopped again," Mr Timblo added. Mining operations in Goa faced a closure in 2012 too, following a Supreme Court directive.The association estimates that the immediate impact of the recent ban that came into effect on March 15 would be a loss of about 60,000 direct and indirect jobs and affect three lakh people who are dependent on mining besides causing a revenue loss of Rs 3,400 crore to the state.', 'https://i.ndtvimg.com/i/2018-03/goaminingprotest_650x400_41521487017.jpg', 'Hindustan Times', NULL),

The chief minister assured the people that whatever due, would be done for them including creating avenues of employment, strengthening of health facilities and road connectivity. Earlier on her arrival, Ms Mufti met the mother and other kin of the family whose members were killed in yesterday\'s shelling.

The IPFT is a tribal party and an ally of the BJP in the new state government.The demand was raised in New Delhi on Monday during a rally organised by the National Federation for New States.The BJP has now distanced itself from the IPFT\'s core demand. Sources in the BJP said many of its top leaders had said IFPT has toned down its demand for a separate state and so the pre-election alliance was formed, which went on to dislodge the 25-year-old Left government in Tripura.Some 500 members of the IPFT led by its Ampinagar legislator Sindhu Charan Jamatia participated in the rally, holding placards that said "No Twipraland, No Rest".A day after the Tripura election results were declared IPFT chief and now Tripura cabinet minister NC Debbarma had told NDTV that the party would not abandon the demand for a separate Twipraland."It is because of our demand that the centre through MHA (home ministry) has agreed to constitute a high level inter-ministerial committee that would look into why this demand came up in Tripura. So we will again hit the streets in favour of our demand," he had said.The demand has given the opposition in Tripura -- both the Left and the Congress -- to corner the BJP over their alliance partner.Communist Party of India (Marxist) or CPI(M) parliamentarian from Tripura Jitendra Chaudhury alleged that IPFT had been forcefully raising money from locals for their rally and the BJP had been turning a blind eye."How can a representative of the state government demand a separate statehood?
